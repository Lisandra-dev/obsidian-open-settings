## Open Plugin Settings

This plugin allows you to create a command to open the settings tabs of a specified plugin.

### Usage

By default, you can open the settings of the plugin itself using the command palette with the `Open Plugin Settings: Open Plugin Settings` command.

To add a command to open the settings of another plugin, click on the add button and search for the plugin you want to add. After that, you can use the command `Open Plugin Settings: Open <plugin name>` to open the settings of the plugin.

From the settings, you can also refresh the list to remove deleted plugins and disable commands of disabled plugins.
